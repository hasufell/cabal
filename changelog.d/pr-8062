synopsis: Support GHC 9.4's `clang`-based Windows toolchain
packages: Cabal
prs: #8062

description {

- As the `lld` linker used by GHC 9.4 and later on Windows does not support
  object merging, it is now an error to enable `--enable-library-for-ghci` on
  Windows with such compilers. Note that this flag is merely enables an
  optimisation and can safely be disabled if you encounter this error.

- `Cabal` will now use `llvm-ar`'s `L` modifier if available when building
  static archives. This enables static library merging which is the behavior
  required by GHC 9.4 and later on Windows.
